Overview

   syrep is a generic file repository synchronization tool. It may be
   used to synchronize large file hierarchies bidirectionally by
   exchanging patch files. Syrep is truely peer-to-peer, no central
   servers are involved. Synchronizations between more than two
   repositories are supported. The patch files may be transferred via
   offline media, e.g. removable hard disks or compact discs.

   Files are tracked by their message digests, currently MD5. The
   following file operations are tracked in the snapshot files: creation,
   deletion, modification, creation of new hard or symbolic links,
   renaming. (The latter is nothing more than a new hard link and removal
   of the old file). syrep doesn't distuinguish between soft and hard
   links. In fact even copies of files are treated as the same.
   Currently, syrep doesn't synchronize file attributes like access modes
   or modification times.

   Syrep was written to facilitate the synchronization of two large
   digital music repositories without direct network connection. Patch
   files of several gigabytes are common in this situation.

   Syrep is able to cope with 64 bit file sizes. (LFS)

   Syrep is optimized for speed. It may make use of a message digest
   cache to accelerate the calculation of digests of a whole directory
   hierarchy.

Status

   Version 0.3 is more or less stable and fulfills its purpose.

Documentation

   Have a look on the man page [13]syrep(1). (A XSLT capable browser is
   required)

  Method of operation

   Syrep's operation relies on "snapshots" of a file repository. A
   snapshot contains information about all files existent in the
   hierarchy combined with a limited history log of file operations.
   Snapshots may be compared, files missing or deleted on one of both
   sides may be detected this way. Based on this knowledge patch files
   containing all missing files may be created and merged.

   To keep the file operation log in a sensible state it is crucial to
   update the snapshot frequently, probably by adding a new cron job.

  Example usage

   Fred and Karl want to synchronize their digital music libraries by
   exchanging an USB hard disk with patch files. As first step, both
   initialize their repositories for usage with syrep:
fred$ syrep -zp --update ~/mp3/
...
karl$ syrep -zp --update ~/mp3/

   Depending on the size of the repositories this takes a lot of time,
   since a message digest is calculated for every file. Since exact
   tracking of all file operations on the repository is crucial for
   effetive synchronization, they both use the time passing to add a new
   entry to their crontab:
1 3 * * * syrep -z --update ~/mp3/

   When the snapshot creation finished, they send the newly created patch
   files ~/mp3/.syrep/curent.syrep to each other. As these snapshots are
   only about 400K of size for a 80GB repository they do that via email:
fred$ mutt -a ~/mp3/.syrep/current.syrep -s "The current snapshot of fred" karl
...
karl$ mutt -a ~/mp3/.syrep/current.syrep -s "The current snapshot of karl" fred

   When the mails arrive they both detach the snapshot and create a patch
   on their USB harddisk containing all local files not existing on the
   other siede:
fred$ mount /mnt/usb
fred$ syrep -p -o /mnt/usb/patch-for-karl --makepatch ~/mp3/ ~/karls-current.sy
rep
fred$ umount /mnt/usb
...
karl$ mount /mnt/usb
karl$ syrep -p -o /mnt/usb/patch-for-fred --makepatch ~/mp3/ ~/freds-current.sy
rep
karl$ umount /mnt/usb

   As next step they exchange their harddisks. Back at home they merge
   the newly acquired patch into their own repository:
fred$ mount /mnt/usb
fred$ syrep -pT --merge /mnt/usb/patch-for-fred ~/mp3/
fred$ umount /mnt/usb
...
karl$ mount /mnt/usb
karl$ syrep -pT --merge /mnt/usb/patch-for-karl ~/mp3/
karl$ umount /mnt/usb

   At this moment both have the same file hierarchy. To update the local
   snapshot log with the newly merged files they both should run --update
   now. This update run should be much quicker since the message digests
   of all unchanged files are read from a message cache created and
   update each time --update runs:
fred$ syrep -zp --update ~/mp3/
...
karl$ syrep -zp --update ~/mp3/

   Some time later Fred got plenty of new music files, while Karl didn't
   change anything on his repository. Thus, Fred is able to use the old
   snapshot he recieved from Karl to generate a new patch for him. He
   does it exactly the same way he did the last time, see above.

   And now, several iterations of the story described above follow.

   That's the end of the story.

   OK, not quite. Sometimes a conflict happens, e.g. at the same time
   both created a file foo.mp3 with different contents. When this happens
   the local copy is always copied into the patch and the user may decide
   during merge which file version he wants to have locally. Because of
   that merging is an interactive task and cannot be automated
   completely.

   There is no need that the synchronization operations happen in such a
   "symmetric" way as described above.

Requirements

   syrep requires installed development versions of [14]zlib and
   [15]Berkeley DB.

   syrep was developed and tested on Debian GNU/Linux "testing" from
   September 2003, it should work on most other Linux distributions and
   may be POSIX implementations since it uses GNU autoconf for source
   code configuration.

   Some support for for big endian architectures is included, however, it
   is incomplete. You're welcome to send me patches.

   If the syrep build system detects Oliver Kurth's [16]xmltoman the man
   page is rebuilt. Otherwise the pre-compiled versions shipped with
   syrep are used.

Installation

   As this package is made with the GNU autotools you should run
   ./configure inside the distribution directory for configuring the
   source tree. After that you should run make for compilation and make
   install (as root) for installation of syrep.

Acknowledgements

   This software includes an implementation of the MD5 algorithm by L.
   Peter Deutsch. Thanks to him for this.
