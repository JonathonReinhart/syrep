<h2><a name="overview">Overview</a></h2>

<p><tt>syrep</tt> is a generic file repository synchronization tool. It may be
used to synchronize large file hierarchies bidirectionally by
exchanging patch files. <tt>Syrep</tt> is truely peer-to-peer, no central
servers are involved. Synchronizations between more than two
repositories are supported. The patch files may be transferred via
offline media, e.g. removable hard disks or compact discs.</p>

<p>Files are tracked by their message digests, currently MD5. The
following file operations are tracked in the snapshot files: creation,
deletion, modification, creation of new hard or symbolic links,
renaming. (The latter is nothing more than a new hard link and removal
of the old file). <tt>syrep</tt> doesn't distuinguish between soft and
hard links. In fact even copies of files are treated as the
same. Currently, <tt>syrep</tt> doesn't synchronize file attributes like
access modes or modification times.</p>

<p><tt>syrep</tt> was written to facilitate the synchronization of two
large digital music repositories without direct network
connection. Patch files of several gigabytes are common in
this situation.</p>

<p><tt>syrep</tt> is able to cope with 64 bit file sizes. (LFS)</p>

<p><tt>syrep</tt> is optimized for speed. It may make use of a message digest
cache to accelerate the calculation of digests of a whole directory
hierarchy.</p>

<h3>How does syrep compare with <tt>rsync</tt>, <tt>cvs</tt>, Subversion, <tt>arch</tt>/<tt>tla</tt>, BitKeeper, <tt>xdelta2</tt>, <tt>diff</tt>/<tt>patch</tt>?</h3>

<p><tt>syrep</tt> is kind of a bidirectional <tt>rsync</tt>, but
stores and makes use of a file hierarchy history. Synchronization with
<tt>syrep</tt> is based on patch files, and doesn't require a direct
connection between the synchronizing peers.</p>

<p><tt>syrep</tt> has many things in common with version control
systems like <tt>CVS</tt> or <tt>SVN</tt>: it stores a history and has operations
similar to <tt>update</tt> and <tt>commit</tt>. However: the history doesn't contain
file contents and is not line based, it stores the MD5 digest and some
meta data only. There is no central server, instead all peers have the
same role. There is no distinction between repositories and
checkouts. In fact checkout and repository are identical.</p>

<p><tt>syrep</tt> has even more things in common with <tt>arch</tt>/<tt>tla</tt> and
BitKeeper. All three are patch based and are "peer-to-peer". However,
there are certain differences: <tt>syrep</tt> doesn't differentiate
between repositories and checkouts. <tt>syrep</tt> doesn't keep a file
contents history of any kind.</p>

<p><tt>syrep</tt> resembles <tt>diff</tt>/<tt>patch</tt> or
<tt>xdelta2</tt> in some way. While the latter work on file
contents, <tt>syrep</tt> works on file hierarchies.</p>

<p>In contrast two most of the software mentioned above,
<tt>syrep</tt> is capable of synchronizing repositories of several
100GB of size, with only a very small overhead. (i.e. 4 MB of control
data for half a year history for 100 GB of user data)</p>

<h2><a name="status">Status</a></h2>

<p>Version 0.7 is more or less stable and fulfills its purpose.</p>
  
<h2><a name="documentation">Documentation</a></h2>

<p>Have a look on the man page <a href="http://0pointer.de/lennart/projects/syrep/syrep.1.xml"><tt>syrep(1)</tt></a>. (A XSLT capable browser is required)</p>

<h3>Method of operation</h3>

<p><tt>Syrep</tt>'s operation relies on "snapshots" of a file
repository. A snapshot contains information about all files existent
in the hierarchy combined with a limited history log of file
operations. Snapshots may be compared, files missing or deleted on one
of both sides may be detected this way. Based on this knowledge patch
files containing all missing files may be created and merged.</p>

<p>To keep the file operation log in a sensible state it is crucial to
update the snapshot frequently, probably by adding a new <tt>cron</tt>
job.</p>

<h3>Example usage</h3>

<p>Fred and Karl want to synchronize their digital music libraries by
exchanging an USB hard disk with patch files. As first step, both
initialize their repositories for usage with <tt>syrep</tt>:</p>

<pre>fred$ syrep -zp --update ~/mp3/
...
karl$ syrep -zp --update ~/mp3/</pre>

<p>Depending on the size of the repositories this takes a lot of time,
since a message digest is calculated for every file. Since exact
tracking of all file operations on the repository is crucial for
effetive synchronization, they both use the time passing to add a new
entry to their <tt>crontab</tt>:</p>

<pre>1 3 * * * syrep -z --update ~/mp3/</pre>

<p>When the snapshot creation finished, they send the newly created
patch files <tt>~/mp3/.syrep/curent.syrep</tt> to each other. As these
snapshots are only about 400K of size for a 80GB repository they do
that via email:</p>

<pre>fred$ mutt -a ~/mp3/.syrep/current.syrep -s "The current snapshot of fred" karl
...
karl$ mutt -a ~/mp3/.syrep/current.syrep -s "The current snapshot of karl" fred</pre>

<p>When the mails arrive they both detach the snapshot and create a
patch on their USB harddisk containing all local files not existing on
the other siede:</p>

<pre>fred$ mount /mnt/usb
fred$ syrep -p -o /mnt/usb/patch-for-karl --makepatch ~/mp3/ ~/karls-current.syrep
fred$ umount /mnt/usb
...
karl$ mount /mnt/usb
karl$ syrep -p -o /mnt/usb/patch-for-fred --makepatch ~/mp3/ ~/freds-current.syrep
karl$ umount /mnt/usb
</pre>

<p>As next step they exchange their harddisks. Back at home they merge the newly acquired patch into their own repository:</p>

<pre>fred$ mount /mnt/usb
fred$ syrep -pT --merge /mnt/usb/patch-for-fred ~/mp3/
fred$ umount /mnt/usb
...
karl$ mount /mnt/usb
karl$ syrep -pT --merge /mnt/usb/patch-for-karl ~/mp3/
karl$ umount /mnt/usb
</pre>

<p>At this moment both have the same file hierarchy. To update the
local snapshot log with the newly merged files they both should run
<tt>--update</tt> now. This update run should be much quicker since
the message digests of all unchanged files are read from a message
cache created and update each time <tt>--update</tt> runs:</p>

<pre>fred$ syrep -zp --update ~/mp3/
...
karl$ syrep -zp --update ~/mp3/</pre>

<p>Some time later Fred got plenty of new music files, while Karl
didn't change anything on his repository. Thus, Fred is able to use
the old snapshot he recieved from Karl to generate a new patch for
him. He does it exactly the same way he did the last time, see
above.</p>

<p>And now, several iterations of the story described above
follow.</p>

<p>That's the end of the story.</p>

<p>OK, not quite. Sometimes a conflict happens, e.g. at the same time both created a
file <tt>foo.mp3</tt> with different contents. When
this happens the local copy is always copied into the patch and the
user may decide during merge which file version he wants to have
locally. Because of that merging is an interactive task and cannot be
automated completely.</p>

<p>There is no need that the synchronization operations happen in such
a "symmetric" way as described above.</p>

<h2><a name="requirements">Requirements</a></h2>

<p><tt>syrep</tt> requires installed development versions of <tt><a
href="http://www.gzip.org/zlib/">zlib</a></tt> and <tt><a
href="http://www.sleepycat.com/">Berkeley DB</a></tt> 4.3. If you want
build <tt>syrep</tT> with support for extended attributes (currently
supported on Linux only) you have to install <tt>libattr</tt> and a kernel that supports it.</p>

<p><tt>syrep</tt> was developed and tested on Debian GNU/Linux
"testing" from September 2003, it should work on most other Linux
distributions and may be POSIX implementations since it uses GNU
autoconf for source code configuration.</p>

<p>Some support for for big endian architectures is included, however, it is incomplete. You're welcome to send me patches.</p>

<p>If the <tt>syrep</tt> build system detects Oliver Kurth's <a
href="http://masqmail.cx/xml2man/"><tt>xmltoman</tt></a> the man page is
rebuilt. Otherwise the pre-compiled versions shipped with
<tt>syrep</tt> are used.</p>

<h2><a name="installation">Installation</a></h2>

<p>As this package is made with the GNU autotools you should run
<tt>./configure</tt> inside the distribution directory for configuring
the source tree. After that you should run <tt>make</tt> for
compilation and <tt>make install</tt> (as root) for installation of
<tt>syrep</tt>.</p>
